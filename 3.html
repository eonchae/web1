  <p style="margin-top:50px;"><strong>Solána Imani Rowe</strong> (born November 8, 1990), known professionally as <u><a href="https://szactrl.com/" target="_blank" title="szactrl.com">SZA</a></u>, is an American singer and songwriter. In October 2012, SZA self-released her debut EP, See.SZA.Run, which she then followed up with her second EP, S, in April 2013. In July 2013, she signed with the hip hop record label Top Dawg Entertainment, through which she released Z, her third EP and first retail release, in April 2014. In March 2020, it was declared by Billboard that SZA had signed with WME for representation in all areas.</p><p>SZA's debut studio album, Ctrl, was released on June 9, 2017, to universal acclaim from music critics. It debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). " The Weekend" from her Ctrl album peaked at #29 which is her highest charting solo song. The album and its songs were nominated for four Grammy Awards, while SZA was nominated for Best New Artist at the 60th annual ceremony. Ctrl was ranked as the best album of 2017 by Time. SZA collaborated with Maroon 5 for their 2017 record "What Lovers Do," earning SZA her first US Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. She later followed that by featuring on the 2018 Black Panther record with Kendrick Lamar, "All the Stars," which peaked at number 7 in the US and was also nominated for the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Song.</p><p>SZA is a neo soul singer, whose music has been described as alternative R&B, with elements of soul, hip hop, minimalist R&B, cloud rap, witch house, and chillwave. SZA's lyrics are described as "unravelling" and her songs often revolve around themes of sexuality, nostalgia, and abandonment. SZA cites a variety of artists as influences, including Ella Fitzgerald, Meelah, Björk, Jamiroquai, and Lauryn Hill, among others. SZA also takes influence from non-musical artists, including filmmaker Spike Lee.</p>
